## Longer version

Ruby New Zealand is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Ruby New Zealand spaces, including our associated mailing lists, events, Slack group, and projects; both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Ruby New Zealand committee.

Some Ruby New Zealand spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication. 

The Ruby New Zealand committee reserves the right not to act on complaints about someone defending themselves from discrimination or harassment, including:

* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I’m not discussing this with you"
* Criticising discriminatory or harassing attitudes or behaviour, even in a confrontational tone

## Protected measures

Ruby New Zealand will take measures to improve the diversity, inclusivity and accessibility of the community, including:

* Outreach to groups who are under-represented in the Ruby community compared to New Zealand at large, such as women or Māori
* Efforts to make events more accessible to people who would not otherwise be able to participate, such as subsidising tickets for students or paying for ramps or sign language interpreters
* Holding events specifically for groups which are minorities within the Ruby community

Ruby New Zealand will not act on any complaints to the effect that these measures, or actions that support these measures, constitute discrimination.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of Ruby New Zealand, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Ruby New Zealand committee at president@ruby.org.nz or private message one of the committee members on Slack. The current committee member list can be found [here](http://ruby.nz/). If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to Ruby New Zealand spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Ruby New Zealand outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Ruby New Zealand members, especially the committee, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Ruby New Zealand based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Ruby New Zealand spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Ruby New Zealand.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Ruby New Zealand members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Ruby New Zealand committee may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Ruby New Zealand spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Ruby New Zealand members or the general public.
